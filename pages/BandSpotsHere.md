# What is BandSpotsHere?
BandSpotsHere gets data from  [Pskreporter](https://pskreporter.info/) & gives an overview of who’s active and who’s receiving who.

Advantages over Pskreporter map views:
 - See activity for a group of DXCCs rather than a single "country of callsign ..."
 - Get a view of who is actively transmitting and who is just receiving
 - See which DX callsigns are spotting, and being spotted by, the active callsigns in your specified DXCCs
 - Easily compare your own transmit and receive spots with those of other stations in your DXCC group
 - Simultaneously, monitor spot numbers across several other bands to watch for band openings

# Installation
Download this zip file and extract all files and folders into a convenient folder. To run the program, simply double click the file 'BandSpotsHere.bat'.

# Usage
To change the pre-loaded bands and DXCC codes, edit the file 'BandSpotsHere.bat' before running.

Once the program is running, you can cycle through the bands by pressing  the 'b' key.

On busy bands, you will probably not want to see all indidvidual spot details (mainly because this will produce more than one page of output and require you to manually scroll through it), so you can toggle this detail on and off by pressing the 'd' key.

Note that the program doesn't know about spots received from PSKR MQTT before the program was launched.
