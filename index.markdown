# Bio
My Ham Radio callsign is G1OJS and my name is Alan Robinson. 

I'm now retired from 30 years working in the Space Industry after completing a PhD in Electromagnetics in 1992. I've been interested in electronics since I was about 8 or 9 years old (1975?) and had my ham radio license since 1985. I've always been interested in antennas and a lot of what I do now is about making them and testing them.

You can find quite a lot of ham radio content from me on my [G1OJS pages at Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/g1ojs_alan/), and more about me on my [G1OJS page at QRZ.com](https://www.qrz.com/db/G1OJS).
