Hi, this is my Ham Radio website at GitHub. 

My Ham Radio callsign is G1OJS and my name is Alan Robinson. I'm now retired from 30 years working in the Space Industry after completing a PhD in Electromagnetics in 1992.

I'm just getting to grips with building a site using Jekyll hosted on GitHub, so there isn't a lot here at the moment!

You can find quite a lot of ham radio content from me on my G1OJS pages at Instagram, and more about me on my G1OJS page at QRZ.com.

Until I get more content here and work out what navigation I'm going to use, here's the first bit of content:

[Calculating padding capacitors]({{ site.baseurl }}/calculating-padding-capacitors)
