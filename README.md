# üñêÔ∏è Hi, this is my Ham Radio website at GitHub 
 
My Ham Radio callsign is G1OJS and my name is Alan Robinson. I'm now retired from 30 years working in the Space Industry after completing a PhD in Electromagnetics in 1992. I've been interested in electronics since I was about 8 or 9 years old (1975?) and had my ham radio license since 1985. I've always been interested in antennas and a lot of what I do now is about making them and testing them.

I'm just getting to grips with building a site using Jekyll hosted on GitHub, so there isn't a lot here at the moment!

You can find quite a lot of ham radio content from me on my [G1OJS pages at Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/g1ojs_alan/), and more about me on my [G1OJS page at QRZ.com](https://www.qrz.com/db/G1OJS).

Here's the index page for the site:
